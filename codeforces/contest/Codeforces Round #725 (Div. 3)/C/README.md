# C. Number of Pairs

> https://codeforces.com/contest/1538/problem/C

You are given an array a of n integers. Find the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) where the sum of ai+aj is greater than or equal to l and less than or equal to r (that is, l≤ai+aj≤r).

For example, if n=3, a=[5,1,2], l=4 and r=7, then two pairs are suitable:

i=1 and j=2 (4≤5+1≤7);
i=1 and j=3 (4≤5+2≤7).
Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n,l,r (1≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤l≤r≤109) — the length of the array and the limits on the sum in the pair.

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n overall test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of index pairs (i,j) (i<j), such that l≤ai+aj≤r.
