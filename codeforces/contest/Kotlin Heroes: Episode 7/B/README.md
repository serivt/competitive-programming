# B. Nearest Point Function

> https://codeforces.com/contest/1533/problem/B

Your friend has created a nearest point function. For a given array of integer points x (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates) and a point y it can find the nearest point from x to the point y. In other words, it will find such a point xi that |y−xi| is the minimum possible, where |a| is the absolute value of a.

For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11], the answer for y=3 will be 2, the answer for y=5 will be 5 and the answer for y=100 will be 11.

This function is a bit buggy, though. If there are several nearest points to the given one, the function crashes. For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11] (as above) and y=6, the function will crash, since points 5 and 7 are both the nearest points for 6.

Your task is, for a given array of integer points x (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates), determine if it is possible to cause the function to crash by choosing some integer point y.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of points in the array x.

The second line of the test case contains n integers x1,x2,…,xn (1≤xi≤109), where xi is the i-th point in the array x.

All points in the array x are distinct, and the array x is sorted in ascending order (in other words, x1<x2<…<xn).

The sum of n over the test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105).

Output
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to find some integer point y that will crash the function and NO otherwise.
